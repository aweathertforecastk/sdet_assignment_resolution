# Hoover Service Test Results:


# Introduction:


While testing the robotic hoover service, several points of
uncertainty were identified in both the service specification and 
the test execution, which may indicate potential bugs or areas 
requiring further investigation.


# Uncertainty in Room Dimensions and Coordinate System:


The specification states that the room is defined by X and Y 
coordinates, with the top-right corner of the room being the 
maximum point (X, Y). The room is described as a grid with 
dimensions 5x5, resulting in 25 possible hoover positions. 
However, this is somewhat ambiguous when considering the Cartesian 
coordinate system, where the room is said to have 6 indexes
(X: 0 to 5, and Y: 0 to 5), which would result in 36 positions
in total. This raises the question of whether the dimensions should 
actually be interpreted as 5x5, with the maximum coordinates
being X: 4 and Y: 4, which would give 25 positions (rather than 36). 
This inconsistency should be clarified.

Additionally, the service specification describes the room as
rectangular, yet the example provided (X: 5, Y: 5) shows a 
square grid, adding another layer of confusion. This inconsistency
needs to be addressed for better clarity in the problem definition.


# Test Results and Inconsistencies:


A total of 56 test cases were executed, comprising both positive 
and negative tests. Of these, 15 tests failed, including 6 
positive tests and 14 negative tests. Further investigation is 
required to determine the root causes of these failures. The Allure
web page auto-generated after the tests provides additional details, 
which may be useful for debugging.


# Conclusion:


While the test cases have revealed several issues, including 
inconsistencies in the service's behavior and some ambiguous 
specifications, further analysis is required to fully understand the
causes of the test failures.
